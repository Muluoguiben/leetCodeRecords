1.Essentially, we have to multiply the existed ugly numbers by 2, 3 and 5 to get a bigger ugly number, however, if we blindly multiply all the existed numbers by 2, 3 and 5, then the number could grow much faster than needed
2.Hence, every time we only try to find the next smallest ugly number
3.Also, since any existed number will be multiplied by 2, 3 and 5 once and only once, otherwise duplicate, we can use a pointer to keep track of where the 2, 3 and 5 are going to multiply in the next step.
4.Once, we find the next minimum, we can move on the corresponding pointer, otherwise it always stays at the already existed ugly number which would makes pointer useless

优先队列（小根堆）解法
有了基本的分析思路，一个简单的解法是使用优先队列：

起始先将最小丑数 11 放入队列
每次从队列取出最小值 xx，然后将 xx 所对应的丑数 2x2x、3x3x 和 5x5x 进行入队。
对步骤 2 循环多次，第 nn 次出队的值即是答案。
为了防止同一丑数多次进队，我们需要使用数据结构 SetSet 来记录入过队列的丑数。
